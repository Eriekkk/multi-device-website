            <h1>Kyoto Animation Studio</h1>
            <p class="aboutp">Kyoto Animation was co-founded in 1985 by married couple Yoko and Hideaki Hatta; it became a limited
                company in 1985 and a corporation in 1999. Yoko Hatta, who serves as the company's vice president,
                had worked as a painter at Mushi Production until she moved to Kyoto after marrying her husband, who
                serves as president. The company's logo originates from the kanji kyō, the first character of
                Kyoto.</p>

            <p  class="aboutp">
                Kyoto Animation has become recognized for its high production values and "sensitivity to the wonders and
                quandaries of ordinary life". Unlike most animation studios, the company's employees are salaried
                rather than freelance workers, and are trained in-house.These practices have been cited as
                encouraging employees to focus on frame quality rather than production quotas. The company has
                received praise for the positive treatment of its staff, and was honored by Women in Animation with its
                Diversity Award in 2020 for its efforts in creating a gender-balanced workforce and encouraging women to
                enter the industry.
